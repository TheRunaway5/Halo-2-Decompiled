# Complete Halo 2 ONLINE

User-requested consolidated goal, 2026-10-13. This is the acceptance checklist
for all ONLINE work discussed in this chat, including the subsequent direct
peer architecture and modern mesh requirements. Earlier narrower completion
claims do not close the remaining items below.

The full scope is registered as the active app goal. This document is its
tracked acceptance checklist; source changes and bounded test passes do not
close requirements that still need integration or physical validation.

## Required architecture

- The master verifies identity, stores social/clan state, discovers servers,
  matches players, authenticates connection setup and accepts post-carnage
  reports after matches. It does not simulate or relay active match gameplay
  or match voice in the intended default architecture.
- One actual player's PC hosts the authoritative world. Other players connect
  directly over encrypted peer UDP. STUN address discovery may assist setup;
  TURN and master WebSocket media fallback are disabled in the new direct path.
- Automatic host choice tests actual lobby connectivity, latency and upload
  capacity. A host must reach every physical connection owner. Select again
  among surviving eligible PCs during migration. Do not confuse the party
  leader, matchmaking gatherer, player seat and simulation host.
- Keep original Halo 2 behavior faithful wherever recovered code or primary
  public evidence establishes it. Native replacements and unresolved original
  units/coefficients must be labeled explicitly; never fill gaps by guessing.

## Acceptance checklist

| Area | Required final behavior | Current acceptance boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Discord login required for persistent ONLINE identity; hide account IDs; preserve chosen Halo screen names | Existing implementation; retain in every new transport, invite and result path |
| Native navigation | Quickmatch, Optimatch and Playlists launch real admitted online games; server browser joins community servers | Match launch exists; community server joining remains outstanding |
| UI | ONLINE capitalization; high-resolution Vista assets/fonts throughout ONLINE and clans; readable screens without the obstructing Halo 2 logo; correct real clan-screen dimensions and widescreen bounds | Existing UI work must be retained and checked in delivered builds |
| Social | Complete Discord friends/presence, native invitations, accepted parties and correct launch/return behavior | Existing SDK/native flows require regression and remaining live checks |
| Clans | Complete create/join/invite/manage/leave flows, matchmaking and original supported clan-rank presentation | Existing clan flows; remaining competitive/presentation coverage stays open |
| Couch players | Up to four local players per PC can queue/play together against others; verified secondary accounts retain their own stats; guests retain local PCR rows but publish no personal stats | Eight-player/two-PC native fixture exercised; physical controllers and independent voice devices are separate gates |
| Gameplay transport | Default ONLINE gameplay travels directly between players, with one player authoritative; no master media relay | v12 installed in both launchers and deployed; local native/rendered flows and one consumer-to-Vultr UDP probe passed; two consumer NATs remain unverified |
| Match voice | Direct peer proximity, team/FFA radio, dead-player audiences, muting and postgame voice; complete source-supported lobby/loading, LAN and device coverage | Match/postgame voice now uses direct UDP; party/clan menu voice still uses its relay and remains to convert; LAN voice, all-participant loading voice, independent couch headsets/mics, masking and original radio audio remain open |
| Master outage | Peer simulation and voice continue through temporary signaling loss; reports retry safely afterward | Temporary master-socket outage acceptance passed:89 simulation ticks and86/88 audible frames continued, then reports uploaded; master-process-restart admission persistence remains open |
| Disconnect survival | A nonhost departure does not end the room; a graceful or abrupt host loss preserves and resumes the actual world | Complete runtime departure/retained-result and authoritative continuation integration remain open |
| Migration | Preserve complete player/unit/weapon/inventory, allocation identities, RNG, timers, projectiles/grenades, props, devices, physics, recording/results, local profiles and voice; promote/rebind a validated survivor | Byte-bank/device, native VM/physical/pool, synchronization and retired startup-arena/file checkpoints have focused continuation evidence; full live-world composition, typed simulation/match ownership and gameplay handoff remain open |
| Historical playlists | Final-2010 target with the fullest evidence-supported rotations/game coverage; casual/ranked matching follows recovered/public Halo 2 logic, including Max Hoberman's explanations | Final downloaded catalog not recovered; full objective engines/rotations remain open |
| Custom modes | Finish and bundle authored Fiesta Slayer and Halo-3-inspired Infection Slayer, including green zombies, under data/tags and release packaging; include Action Sack | Existing authored variants/packaging must survive transport/build changes |
| Tombstone | Include the installed map in sensible supported Slayer, Team Slayer, CTF, Fiesta and other suitable pools | Fiesta active; staged Slayer/Team Slayer and unfinished objective coverage need their native engine acceptance |
| Competitive policy | Finish supported quit penalties, later ranking behavior and original clan-rank display without inventing missing historical values | Remaining policies/evidence gates stay open |
| Post-carnage history | Upload after the match, validate admission/results/confirmations, store organized persistent report details, support later website lookup by verified Discord username, exclude guest personal history | Existing DB/history and guest tests; preserve across peer migration and master recovery |
| Delivery | Rebuild/install both native launchers, safely deploy backend with state backup/restore verification, package authored data and dependency notices | Every changed delivery needs fresh recorded verification; source presence alone is insufficient |

## Modern mesh extension requirements

Implement as modular C++20 owners over the existing physical peer table, with
thread-safe telemetry and vote snapshots using bounded queues, lightweight
locks/atomics, and no Discord identifiers in peer presentation.

1. **Client-side voter quorum.** More than 500 ms without host packets enters
   `SUSPECTED_DEAD` and sends a lightweight authenticated verification probe to
   the active nonhost mesh. A strict majority of the agreed nonhost membership
   must corroborate host silence before revoking that authority generation.
   Bind every vote to the match, host generation, voter and membership view;
   reject replay/duplicate/nonmember votes. Membership removal must preserve
   quorum intersection, rather than allowing each partition to shrink its own
   denominator. A timeout alone must not manufacture a permanent cheating ban.
2. **Decentralized telemetry.** During the pregame lobby, continuously probe
   other PCs on the actual gameplay path and exchange bounded latency/loss/NAT
   telemetry matrices. Analyze asymmetric loss claims and conservatively
   disqualify suspect candidates from host eligibility. NAT/path failures are
   not proof of cheating; preserve unknown NAT classifications until measured.
3. **Asynchronous shadow queue.** During gameplay, deterministically order
   eligible peers by the requested mesh-latency/NAT health policy, with stable
   private peer-ID tie-breaks and agreed membership/telemetry generations.
   Identify a shadow host in advance and retain its complete validated world.
   On certified failure, transfer authority and rebind transport within a few
   frames where actual continuation permits. Do not label an endpoint switch
   or a display snapshot seamless simulation migration.

These are new hardening requirements, not claims that the supplied descriptions
of every legacy flaw have already been verified against original Halo 2.
The user requested these after direct transport and the migration foundation.

## Evidence and completion rules

Track focused tests, full native builds, localhost native-process tests, WAN
NAT/throughput tests, visible gameplay, physical controllers/headsets and actual
multi-PC migration separately. Synthetic Discord fixtures do not establish
live authorization, and election fixtures do not establish world continuity.
Retain dirty/concurrent workspace changes and existing Vista asset selection.
Do not mark the goal complete while required work or acceptance remains.

## Direct peer delivery milestone

Both launchers now select `.local/direct-peer-20261013/runtime/halo2_native`.
The backend release is `/opt/halo2/releases/20261014T021753Z`; all36 preexisting
retained tables and the master key matched the isolated backup/restore check.
The new `match_result_consensus` table was empty. The delivery evidence is
[verification.json](/home/eric/Developer/Halo-2-Decompiled/.local/direct-peer-20261013/verification.json).
This closes the bounded direct-transport delivery stage, not the full goal or
gameplay host migration.
